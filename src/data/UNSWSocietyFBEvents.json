Before her 21st birthday, Clara Wieck was entrenched in a series of legal battles with her father to marry the composer and pianist Robert Schumann; a man she diligently nursed through various afflictions and illnesses later in life, whilst still maintaining her own international career as a concert pianist. One of the most prestigious and progressive musicians of the romantic era, she changed the very nature of piano recitals, reformed expectations of chamber music, and whose revolutionary ideas fostered two of the most prolific young musicians of the era \u2013 Joachim and Brahms. Her Piano Trio in G minor is a testament to her revered abilities as both composer and performer. This is accompanied by the exuberance of Robert Schumann\u2019s Piano Quintet, which in itself is considered one of the greatest masterpieces of nineteenth century chamber music. The two pieces complementing the program are tributes to both Clara and her husband; an Homage \u00e1 Robert Schumann by Hungarian-born Gy\u00f6rgy Kurtag, and the newly commissioned work by Australian composer Natalie Williams, New work - Letters to Clara, stand as testament to the Schumanns and their life\u2019s work. \n\nSCHUMANN | M\u00e4rchenerz\u00e4hlungen (Fairy Tales) Op. 132\nWILLIAMS | New work (Letters to Clara) - first performance \nSCHUMANN | Piano Trio in G minor Op. 17 \nSCHUMANN | Piano Quintet Op. 44 in E flat major \n\nTickets: $54/$41/$32/$15 (Adult/Senior/Concession/Student rush)", "society": "MPU.UNSW", "id1": null, "data__place__location__latitude": "-33.916903448049", "data__place__location__longitude": "151.2344455719", "going": 0, "data__went": 2, "interested": 2, "eventName": "Australia Ensemble presents: Robert and Clara", "date": "12 May", "data__start_time": "8:00", "data__end_time": "10:00", "data__Time_From_To": "0", "about": "The Music Performance Unit is proud to host and support all music-based productions and ensembles at UNSW.", "fan_count": "251", "website": "http://www.music.unsw.edu.au/", "cover__cover_id": "419727095027988", "cover__offset_x": "0", "cover__offset_y": "58", "cover__source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/17212131_419727095027988_50701318385464813_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=2850a2c94580991839a7b72c9516209a&oe=5B7FDA83", "cover__id": "419727095027988", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/MPU.UNSW/", "emails": "['australia.ensemble@unsw.edu.au']", "founded": "", "isSaved": 0}, {"id": 737, "data__id": "169741677024764", "data__description": "Weekly First Aid training meeting!", "society": "StJohnAmbulanceAustraliaUNSWDivision", "id1": null, "data__place__location__latitude": "-33.918016353275", "data__place__location__longitude": "151.22731089592", "going": 0, "data__went": 4, "interested": 2, "eventName": "Week 12 Training Meeting", "date": "21 May", "data__start_time": "18:30", "data__end_time": "20:30", "data__Time_From_To": "0", "about": "We are ordinary people doing extraordinary things in our local communities - people with a commitment to practical and compassionate caring.", "fan_count": "242", "website": "http://www.stjohnnsw.com.au", "cover__cover_id": "111045452883091", "cover__offset_x": "36", "cover__offset_y": "0", "cover__source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/20139669_111045452883091_2788231034862443078_n.png?_nc_cat=0&oh=bace3296b78afc2f0022db57d2373a71&oe=5B85D3BD", "cover__id": "111045452883091", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/StJohnAmbulanceAustraliaUNSWDivision/", "emails": "['UniversityofNSW.Division@stjohnnsw.com.au']", "founded": "6th March 2000", "isSaved": 0}, {"id": 709, "data__id": "297788117423437", "data__description": "UV lit AF\n\nSummer&#039;s over, but we&#039;re still bringing the heat at our END OF SESSION | FULL MOON PARTY.
